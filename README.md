# Script-of-Midprogress

Beginning with a simple thing on the side, it involves the use of being able to use the IP address as necessary. Granted, it was a bit of something to figure out everything as necessary. So for the matter at hand,
it allowed for some beginning progress to then proceed with the necessary parts and steps to get what needs to be done. It would involve some more on checking the necessary parts, sure, but it would allow
for a lot of experimentation before proceeding with doing so in earnest. Admittedly, there was some amount of testing the waters to then more properly get it done. This will allow for the project in general
to then fully begin and to now progress beyond what is simply just putting it there and letting it all go into motion. 

Although it can be a bit tedious at first, it permitted for some more experimentation as knowledge was then built up from the simple use of the attack machine. this would then build up to the addition of 
checking the other ports as time goes on, for much was being added on in terms of knowledge as it went on forward. It was a bit tedious, but it eventually helped for reaching onto the API, the other 
parts necessary for making more of the actions needed, and so on and so forth. The only issue was that the time ran out in the process multiple times, so some things had to be restarted just to continue.
In the end, while I was close to cracking the user flag, the time ran out as I didn't pay attention to the time. Sometimes these things just happen.
